%C - This is a QNX/Photon Application.
%C [options]

Options:
  -r file.r.c	Name of source file. The file should have the extension
                .r.c if it was created in rebel, or the extension
                .d.c if it is a compiled spot file
  -s server     Server node or device name
  -x x[%][r]	Initial x position in pixels, or as a percentage of
                screen width if % is specified. If r is specified, the
                the coordinate is relative to the current console. 
  -y y[%][r]    Initial y position in pixels, or as a percentage of
                screen height if % is specified. If r is specified, the
                the coordinate is relative to the current console.
  -h h[%]       Initial h dimension in pixels, or as a percentage of the
                screen width if % is specified.
  -w w[%]       Initial w dimension in pixels, or as a percentage of the
                screen height if % is specified. 
  -S i|m|n      Initial window state: i=iconified, m=maximized, n=normal

Examples:
%C -r tstramp.r.c
  start rebel and open tstramp.r.c

%C -r tstramp.d.c
  start rebel and open tstramp.d.c that was generated by spot

%C -s4
  Run using Photon server on node 4

%C -s//4/dev/photon
  Same as above

%C -x10 -y10 -h200 -w300
  Run at initial position 10,10 with initial dimension of 200x300.
