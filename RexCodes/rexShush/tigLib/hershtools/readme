Here are some programs for making use of the Hershey character data.  Eplot
and hplot allow the editing of vector fonts and the creation of other fonts
from them -- vfont format raster fonts, PostScript analytic fonts -- as
well as tfm files for TeX.  The file format for vector fonts is idiosyncratic,
I'm sorry to say.  I have not had access to the Hershey data in the usual
formats.  I have included two sets of four files each containing the Hershey
simplex and triplex Roman characters in the format required for these
programs -- these are sr?.chr and tr?.chr, where the ? is c for capital
letters, s for small letters, d for digits, or p for punctuation.  Just
in case anyone has the Hershey data in the compressed form I have it in
(similar the National Bureau of Standards form) I included the utility
htrans, which converts from the compressed form to my form.  (By the way,
I would really like to have the Hershey data for oriental characters.)

These programs have compiled ok in the Ultrix 1.2 and Sun 3.0 versions of
BSD 4.2.

Parts of the source (termio.c, termio.h) were taken from the Xum package
distributed in net.sources by John Paul O'Brien, Nova University, Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, {allegra, ucf-cs, usfvax2}!novavax!john, and (vfont.c) from
the Hfont package by William LeFebvre, Department of Computer Science,
Rice University, <phil@Rice.edu>.  These appear to be in the public domain.
I am grateful to the above for the use of their code, and I hereby place
the rest of the code and documents for these programs in the public domain.
