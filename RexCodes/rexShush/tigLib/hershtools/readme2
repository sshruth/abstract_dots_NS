A while back I posted some Hershey utilities to edit files of
vector data and to create from them various sorts of fonts.
However, the vector data is in an idiosyncratic format -- .chr
files.  Now here are routines to create such files from the
Hershey data in the form in which it was posted in volume 4
of mod.sources.  Rather than use the .hmp format for specifying
a mapping from Hershey character number to ascii, I decided
to use the .spec format of William LeFebvre's hfont package
(in volume 5 of comp.sources.unix), since it is more complete.
But means for creating .spec files from the data in the .hmp
files that come with the Hershey data are here included.

If these files are placed in the same directory as the Hershey
data, one can proceed as follows:
	(1) make
	    (constructs programs cnv and h2s)
	(2) make occidental
	    (occidental is hersh.oc? concatenated)
	(3) make <name>.chr
	    OR make <name>.spec THEN make <name>.chr
	    (where <name>.hmp is one of the Hershey map files)

For oriental fonts, create (somehow) a .spec file with a
first line "repertory oriental", make oriental, then
	cnv <name.spec >name.chr

Here are also 3 patch files, dif-*, which ought to be applied
to the source files I distributed previously, to make the utilities
eplot and hplot more compatible with the .chr files generated
through the above procedure.

The code in cnv.c was adapted from hershey.c by James Hurt (translated
by Pete Holzmann) and from hfont.c by William LeFebvre.
