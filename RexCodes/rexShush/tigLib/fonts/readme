 This directory contains programs for modifying the
 Hershey fonts as used by tig.
 
  1. vectoasc creates an ascii file from a Hershey font file.
     
       The ascii file can then be edited to correct individual
       characters in a font. 
 
  2. asctovec converts an ascii file to a Hershey font file
     in tig format.
     
       After creating an editing an ascii file using vectoasc,
       this file would be converted back using asctovec.
       
  3.  vecstat and disfnt are support programs fro the above
      programs.  vecstat lists width, vaddr, and nvecs for each
      character in a font.  disfnt displays the fonts.
