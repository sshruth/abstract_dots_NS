Directory:	hdr (REX header files)

	This directory contains various header files used by all REX
processes.  The extension for all header files is ".h".  Some rules
about header files should be observed:

	1.)  Header files should not have includes in them for other
	header files.
	2.)  Data should be declared by externs only.  Each REX process
	has an initialization file named "i.c" in which size declarations
	and initializations are done.
	3.)  In addition to not containing data, headers should also
	not contain instructions- that is the compilation of a header
	alone should not yield any generated code in either text or
	data spaces.

	These rules are not required by Unix or the C compiler.  However
following them makes the management of a large system such as REX
much easier.
