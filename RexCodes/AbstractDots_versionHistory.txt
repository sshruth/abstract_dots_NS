GENERAL NOTE ABOUT HOW REX HANDLES TARGET COLORS AND LOCATIONS
It is important to set Task1_info menu field t_flag to 3
In this setting, vs_dots.c assigns T1 as correct target for rightward motion and T2 for leftward motion. Caveat: You can change the second argument in the call to vsd_update_display in the paradigm file to 1 to flip this association. Not recommended!!
The colors for the targets are assigned in the menu Task1_objList. Menu number 3 corresponds to T1 and number 4 corresponds to T2. 
CONFUSING: In the paradigm the target locations are specified as VSD_OBJECT_Tn->vertex and VSD_OBJECT_Tn->wrt. The n's here are NOT mapped to T1 and T2! Instead, in vsd_update_display, these are converted to Tn-> x & y based on the actual direction of motion in that trial. So same target location can get either a cyan or a yellow even if it always specified as VSD_OBJECT_Tn in the paradigm. 

 
________________ABSTRACT DOTS STANDARD VERSION_______________
SET 01: 
Target locations were hardcoded in vs_dots_v01. Runs under AbstractDots02
No of target locations could be controlled by State_vars->Proportion_TEYE. Options are 2, 4 & 8, which uses the top two, top two+bottom two and all 4 locations respectively. 

SET 02: 
Target locations can now be specified. Runs under AbstractDots02. Quadrant 1 location to be set using 
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->vertex as x
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->wrt as y
This location is reflected across the 4 quadrants. Can still use Proportion_TEYE for # of target locations.

This version of vs_dots is now deprecated to vs_dots02

SET 03:
Moved target location specification into the AbstractDots file itself from vs_dots.

a. AbstractDots03: Set the two target locations at 
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->x and task1_object_varsÑ>object4->x
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->y and task1_object_varsÑ>object4->y
The two target locations are reflected along the horizontal axis. So always 4 target locations now. No control over it. 

b. AbstractDots04: The target locations are set by RF_radius and RF_theta. In RF_jitter, specify the maximum theta that can be randomly added to RF_theta on each trial.

c. AbstractDots05: (Trial ID: 35)
* It's now possible to control fraction of trials at particular coherences to fight biases. Trials of direction specified by Skip_dir and of coherence lower than that specified by Skip_coh will be skipped with the probability specified by Skip_p (0-1000). Uses gl_sbet_shown to indicate skipped trials. 

d. AbstractDots06: (Trial ID: 36)
* USE ONLY FOR TRAINING. Hijacks in mat_dotsDefine, the speed code to send a coh_std value that is used on the PTB side to ramp up coherence within trial. Use dotsDefine_ramp on the PTB side to go with this. The rex chosen coh_std value is sent as EC_TAG2:I_PLSSIZE (8055).
* Can generate two types of ramps controlled by the main menu variable Coh_ramp. 
	1: Exponential rise of coherence.  
	2: Switches from 0 to full coherence in one frame. 


____________ABSTRACT DOTS VARIABLE DURATION__________
In this version of the task, the targets come on after the dots, but the FP stays on for a variable duration after that. The animal is allowed to choose a target only after the FP is off. 

a. AbstractDots_VD01: (Trial ID: 41)
Forked from AbstractDots05. Version allows control of target luminance in two steps, once after the target comes on and another when the FP goes off. Unfortunately, only one target on code is sent at the first appearance. 

b. AbstractDots_VD02: (Trial ID: 42)
* Target jittering removed. Now number of target locations can be specified in main menu RF_n
	- If 1, 90¡ is added to that location for the second target
	- If 2, the location in 1 are mirrored on the y-axis
	- If 4, the unused pairings of two are now in play
* Drops different codes for reward and prize

c. AbstractDots_VD03: (Trial ID: 43)
* FP stays on for a little bit on fix breaks 

d. AbstractDots_VD04: (Trial ID: 44)
* FP off times are drawn from an increasing exponential distribution

d. AbstractDots_VD05: (Trial ID: 45)
* Target locations are now specified as +90, +180 and +270 from RF theta.
* Early fix breaks can be punished

e. AbstractDots_VD06: (Trial ID: 46)
* Monkey's choices are recorded even with a fix break during FP off wait
* Drops target color codes

f. AbstractDots_VD07: (Trial ID: 47)
* Can handle 6 Target locations at 60¡ spacing from RF. 

g. TODO   
* Cleaner way to skip trials that does not rely on sure bet



____________ABSTRACT DOTS IN RF (For Recordings)__________
a. AbstractDotsInRF01: (Trial ID: 50)
Forked from AbstractDots05. Usable in single and array recordings. 
* RF_n specifies the number of RFs to consider
	- If 1, single electrode recording. Targets are separated by 120¡ and Target 1 or Target 2 appears in RF in 66% of trials. 
	- If 2, multichannel recording with 2 clearly separated RFs. 
	- If 3, multichannel recording with 3 RFs, but RF1 & 2 are too close for simultaneous target presentation.
