SET 01: 
Target locations were hardcoded in vs_dots_v01. Runs under AbstractDots02
No of target locations could be controlled by State_vars->Proportion_TEYE. Options are 2, 4 & 8, which uses the top two, top two+bottom two and all 4 locations respectively. 

SET 02: 
Target locations can now be specified. Runs under AbstractDots02. Quadrant 1 location to be set using 
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->vertex as x
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->wrt as y
This location is reflected across the 4 quadrants. Can still use Proportion_TEYE for # of target locations.

This version of vs_dots is now deprecated to vs_dots02

SET 03:
Moved target location specification into the AbstractDots file itself from vs_dots.

a. AbstractDots03: Set the two target locations at 
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->x and task1_object_varsÑ>object4->x
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->y and task1_object_varsÑ>object4->y
The two target locations are reflected along the horizontal axis. So always 4 target locations now. No control over it. 

b. AbstractDots04: The target locations are set by RF_radius and RF_theta. In RF_jitter, specify the maximum theta that can be randomly added to RF_theta on each trial.

c. AbstractDots05: 
* Ability to control fraction of trials at particular coherences to fight biases. 
? The eye check window grows after choosing (maybe repurpose sure-bet target window).
