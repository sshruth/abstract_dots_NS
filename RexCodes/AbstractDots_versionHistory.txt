SET 01: 
Target locations were hardcoded in vs_dots_v01. Runs under AbstractDots02
No of target locations could be controlled by State_vars->Proportion_TEYE. Options are 2, 4 & 8, which uses the top two, top two+bottom two and all 4 locations respectively. 

SET 02: 
Target locations can now be specified. Runs under AbastractDots02. Quadrant 1 location to be set using 
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->vertex as x
task1_object_varsÑ>object3->wrt as y
This location is reflected across the 4 quadrants. Can still use Proportion_TEYE for # of target locations.
